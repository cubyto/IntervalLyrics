She second guesses her dresses
Worries about imperfections
When she looks in the mirror
I wish she'd see what I see
She don't know, I don't care
How straight or curly her hair
Any boy anywhere'd be happy to have her
Like I do

It's hard to believe
That the prettiest girl in the world
Needs to hear somebody loves her
As much at her worst as I do at her best
In my wildest dreams I'd never've guessed
I'd be the one holdin' the prettiest girl in the world

Starts down deep in her heart
There in her eyes is a spark
Every time she smiles
Still knocks me off my feet
She's on some dance floor twirlin'
She don't see the heads turnin'
Lucky for me I get to be the one
To tell her the news

It's hard to believe
That the prettiest girl in the world
Needs to hear somebody loves her
As much at her worst as I do at her best
In my wildest dreams I'd never've guessed
I'd be the one holdin' the prettiest girl in the world

It's hard to believe
That the prettiest girl in the world
Needs to hear somebody loves her
As much at her worst as I do at her best
In my wildest dreams I'd never've guessed
I'd be the one holdin' the prettiest girl
Can't believe I'm holdin' the prettiest girl in the world

The prettiest girl in the world
